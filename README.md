# Project: 2D Ray Tracing #

The following project performed as a part of "Advanced Programming" course offered by Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the winter semester of 2022/2023.

## Description ##
We have defined a 2D screen and created two circles and one square on it. To estimate the distance from the objects to the camera, we evaluate the intersection of the ray with the corresponding object. If an intersection exists, we compute the distance between the point of intersection and the camera and display a pixel of a specific color. If no intersection exists, the background color is computed.

The user can adjust the origin of the camera, and therefore the origin of the rays using the arrow keys on the keyboard, creating a sense of movement. The scene can be zoomed in or out using the mouse scroll wheel. The program terminates and closes the window when the user presses the Enter key.

When the program is running, the calculation time per frame is recorded. Upon program termination, a file named _time_stamp.log_ is created, which contains a list of the calculation time per frame at each moment and the maximum number of frames per second (FPS).

## Prerequisites ##
In order to compile and run the code, it is necessary to download the SDL2 and Eigen libraries into the system. One can simply do that by entering in the terminal:  
`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`  
`sudo apt install libeigen3-dev`  

## Run the code ##
In the folder where you cloned the repository, run the following in the terminal:  
`cmake CMakeLists.txt`  
`cd main`  
`make`  
`./project_raytracing` 

## Code optimization ##
To optimize the code, we started by profiling the program. We discovered that the bottleneck was in the `Scene::create()` method. This method is called at the start of the program or when the user moves or zooms the objects, and it updates all pixels in the window. 

To improve the efficiency and performance of the program, we took the following steps:
1. We declared all necessary variables as `const`. Using constant variables can potentially improve optimization by allowing the compiler to make more aggressive assumptions about the values of variables. 
2. We implemented runtime polymorphism using a base class _GeometricBody_ and derived classes _Circle_ and _Square_. We created objects of these classes using raw pointers and stored them in a vector of _GeometricBody_ objects, rather than having separate vectors for each class. This allowed us to compute the interaction of the object with the rays using a single for loop (and iteracting over the base class pointer) instead of using multiple for loops, one for each object type.
3. We tried to parallelise the loop which iterates through the different objects to check whether a ray is hitting them or not. We used the `std::for_each` algorithm, but no reduction in the execution time of the `Scene::create()` was observed. Then we tried to parallelise the same loop using the `#pragma omp parallel for` from the OpenMP library. Nonetheless, we did not observe any time reduction either. Finally we parallelised the inner for-loop which traverses each pixel in a row using again the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. We did observe a reduction by a factor of two in the execution time of `Scene::create()`.
