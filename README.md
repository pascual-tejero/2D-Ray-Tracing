# Project: 2D Ray Tracing #

The following project performed as a part of "Advanced Programming" offered by Technical University of Munich (TUM). 

## Project Members ##

## Description ##
We defined a 2D screen and created a small circle. In order to estimate the distance from the circle to the camera, we first evaluated the intersection of the ray with the circle, and if such intersection exists we computed the distance between the point of intersection and the camera.
